I used a dark background + high contrast buttons. This improves accessibility and reading experience. I also set up navigation buttons to give viewers a concise reading experience.

Due to text limitations, I changed the number of pages to make it more concise and practical.

Later, I added a button next to each work to return to the top, which made the experience more convenient for the audience.
