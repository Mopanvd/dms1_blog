# This is a heading!!

HI, my name is Mopa. I am from China. And my Chinese name is Junlin Li.I have lived in Australia for four years. My hobbies are walking, hiking and playing computer games.
I made a video about walking and climbing.

# This is a storyboard!
![drik bottle](week1/storyboard.jpg)

First of all, I like aerobic exercise very much. Therefore, I like to go for a walk in the city when I have free time. So the first frame of the storyboard opens the window, which means that the new day is sunny and perfect for walking. Then I arrive under the clock in the center of Melbourne, indicating that this is the place where I passed. Then there is a series of places I walked. Then I arrived at the beach and recorded the beautiful sunset, which means that I spent a day walking. Then the scene changes to me climbing a mountain. There are dozens of seconds of me climbing the mountain, and finally I successfully reach the top.

## This is video portrait:

This short two minute video encompasses two of my passions, walking and climbing. I like to see beautiful scenery, especially after physical exertion, when I am most tired, I can see the scenery that makes me feel comfortable physically and mentally. Therefore, I used the video I recorded before to make this self-portrait. The music in the video is free and copyright-free music I found in the Youtube music library. And after my debugging, it has as many card points as possible.

## sonic elements

 Matenalisationï¼š
â€¢ Emotion
â€¢ Attention
â€¢ Sounds ears and amotion

Materialization is the use of sound to tell the audience about the material reality of objects behind the screen.

The choice to include sound effects over dialogue may be due to the action and animated nature of the show. Sound effects can indicate the material reality of the animated subject.

For example, the sounds of fists and other objects hitting our characters give us a sense of the weight and impact of the objects and the damage each hit causes to our characters.

Without these sounds, the movements would seem more cartoonish and the animated characters would appear disembodied or invincible.

The sounds of bells and wind are what best reflect this aspect in my videos.
## Music
The music I used is copyright-free music from the Youtube music library. The reason I chose this music is that it sounds very positive and upbeat. And it has a rhythmic beat. It is very suitable for walking videos. It is very good with the transitions.
