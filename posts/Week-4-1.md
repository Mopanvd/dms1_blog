# Study！
In this study, I learned how to use illustrator simply, such as how to make a simple graphic, and how to draw with only a pen.


# Assignment 2 brief
This time the assignment is to make 18 icons, each in a group of two. When I click on an icon, it will transform into another icon.

The keyword that attracted me the most in Assignment 2 is memory. Because when I was growing up, the world has changed dramatically. Almost all items have been updated. For example, more than a decade ago, mobile phones still had buttons. Headphones were only wired. Televisions were also very bulky. This gave me a lot of ideas. I can draw icons that represent the past, and turn them into modern icons after clicking.
Therefore, I will use Illustrator to make all the icons. The content is about memories. The platform of the icons is the iPhone. It is suitable for chat emoticons. The audience is 16 to 25 years old.And they like to play games.
