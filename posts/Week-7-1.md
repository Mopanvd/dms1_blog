# Rough top-down map

# Brainstorming
I want to create a game world that I long for. This game is warm and comfortable. My idea is to make some exaggerated plants, which can be huge. When people see them, they feel as if they are in a fairy tale world. This game must also be playable. I thought of my favorite sport - mountain climbing. Maybe I can make some jumping music for mountain climbing to add fun to the game. On the right side of the rough picture I drew, my idea is to make a paradise in nature. There are flowers, grass, and trees. The facilities in nature that I think of are stones. I will use stones to build some interesting buildings there. Just like in fairy tales.

# assets
Trees, stones, flowers, grass, houses, mountains.The sound of doors opening, warm music and mysterious music.
