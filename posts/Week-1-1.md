# This is a Introduction!!

Hi, everyone. My name is Mopa. I am a chinese. My chinese name is Junlin Li. My hobby is playing computer games. No matter what game it is, I find it fun as long as I play it with friends.At the same time, I especially like mountain climbing. I like the feeling of going through all the hard work to get to the top. Every time I climb a mountain, I feel like I have conquered the world, as if I have reached the top of the world.

I am from China. I have lived in Australia for 4 years.In Australia I completed high school and diploma.Currently studying Bachelor of Digital Media at RMIT.

Why did I choose digital media?I can’t give a standard answer myself. But what is certain is that I am interested in digital media. Because I like playing games and watching videos. I especially like to watch some funny videos posted by bloggers. This makes me happy and yearning. Because the blogger in the video is happily making videos, he can also get a lot of money. Isn’t this what most people aspire to make money while playing? This may be my goal. Although I’m not sure about my future direction.
