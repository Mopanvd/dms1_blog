# Iteration of 3D models
When choosing a suitable 3D model for my game, I chose many. But not all of them can be used. Some colors and shapes are very suitable for my theme. But after using mesh collision, I can't achieve the effect I want. In the end, I can only delete it and continue to look for the next one.
