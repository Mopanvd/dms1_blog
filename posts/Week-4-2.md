# AT2 thumbnail sketches

All the sketches I made are very similar. I think I should choose the more prominent ones to make icons. But they should not be too exaggerated. For example, a bunch of grasses vs. a single grass. I chose a single grass. Because it is neater and more beautiful, and it is relatively simple to make. My first little man icon is relatively simple and direct. My idea is that the little man jumps up after clicking. The second watermelon turns into a cut watermelon after I click it. The third is a sword, which turns into a shield after I click it. The fourth is a cassette, which turns into headphones after clicking. This headphone should highlight the sense of music. Therefore, I need a musical note to appear. The fifth is a mobile phone, which turns into a message icon after clicking. The sixth is grass, which turns into a big tree after clicking. The seventh is a milk bottle, which turns into a red wine glass after clicking.The eighth one is a gold coin, which turns into a bank card after clicking it. This also means that we have grown up. The ninth one is a box, which turns into a toy car after clicking it. This means that our childhood is like a toy car, and finally it is sealed in the box.
