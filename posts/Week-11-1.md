# Wireframes in Figma Slides

I searched for some websites online and took screenshots. I studied which wireframes they would fit in Figma. I found that every website was different. But as long as I drew the graphics based on the wireframes, they would look good.

# My work

I first drew a rough wireframe. Then I used the columns in the layout guide to adjust the best spacing. 
After continuous testing, I found that the wireframe corners bent 80 degrees is the best. Because it is smoother.
