Transformation: When you go out and see a huge flower, you walk a few steps forward and hear mysterious music coming from the mountains. You look over curiously and find some stones surrounding the mountain like stairs, and there is a temple on the top of the mountain. At this time, you will be curious to climb the mountain. When you climb up, you will see that the world is really big. There are two trees bigger than the mountain. It's like a fairy tale world. At this time, you look down and you will find some strange stones arranged in strange shapes. You jump down and walk closer. Gradually, you hear warm music. The source of the music is a wine shop. At this time, you may be wondering why you came here. The answer is that you have grown up. After all, minors cannot drink.Climbing a mountain is to tell you that you have reached a certain height, but not the highest height. There are mountains beyond mountains. You should continue to look for higher mountains and cross the walls that imprison you. Try higher peaks, even if you may fail. Just like the small peak you just climbed. Climb up step by step. Even if the end is just a small temple. （I am using this as a metaphor for the transformation of your life.）
