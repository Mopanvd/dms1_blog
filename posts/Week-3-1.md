During the production process, I first arranged each clip of the video and controlled it to two minutes. Then I spent time looking for background music suitable for this video from the free music without copyright. This process is very boring. Because it is difficult to find good music in the free music library. After all, it is free. Then I adjusted the music and faded it in and out. Control the video clips and music to blend together and make it hit the right spot.


This short two minute video encompasses two of my passions, walking and climbing. I like to see beautiful scenery, especially after physical exertion, when I am most tired, I can see the scenery that makes me feel comfortable physically and mentally. Therefore, I used the video I recorded before to make this self-portrait. The music in the video is free and copyright-free music I found in the Youtube music library. And after my debugging, it has as many card points as possible.
