# Feedback
I got some feedback: My topic at the beginning (Mopa's study) is not very suitable as the beginning of the portfolio. Changing it directly to (Mopa) makes it more professional. 

The self-introduction at the beginning is also removed and replaced directly with the photos of the portfolio. It brings the audience closer.
