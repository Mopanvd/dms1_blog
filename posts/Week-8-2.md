# music and sound
I prepared three different musics for this game. One is the music you hear in the house at the beginning of the game. This music is warm. One is the mysterious music played in a temple on the mountain, attracting players to find the source of the sound. The last one is the cozy music played in a wine shop. It makes people feel relaxed and comfortable. These musics all have a characteristic: the closer you are to them, the louder they are. The farther you are from them, the quieter they are until they disappear. There is also the sound of the door opening and closing in the house.
