# Activity!!

In this class, we were divided into two groups, each with 4 people. Then we shared videos with each other and commented on each other's videos.


This is the feedback I got

It seems that they all like my video very much. The only drawback is that the angles of some walking shots are not very good. Actually, what I want to say is that I used a sports camera. At that time, I hung it around my neck and didn't notice that it was crooked. I will pay attention to it next time when shooting properly.

## This is final video:

<iframe id="Walking and Hiking" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GoJoC7V4vzY?si=-_Wd8YgqBVc5_r0h" title="introduction" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<script type="module">

    console.log (`hello world! ðŸš€`)

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`Walking and Hiking`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16

</script>
