# record sounds!

In this class, we went to RMIT's Building 8 Level 7 to borrow the H2N microphone recorder. We recorded at least 9 sound effects. I recorded more than 20 sound effects, and I picked out the most suitable 9 sound effects. And edited each sound effect through Audition.

It was also very interesting to find interesting sounds. I needed to find a very quiet place to record. But there were people everywhere at RMIT. So I tried to find a suitable place in the library. Finally, I found it on the tenth floor above the library. Although it was relatively quiet, the air conditioner was also very loud. In the end, the sound I liked the most was the crisp metallic sound of my fingers tapping the cup.

# funny things

The interesting thing is that we went to the Loan AV in the second basement to borrow it. But it was sold out. So we had to go to the Loan AV in Building 8 level 7 to borrow H2N. It wasted a lot of time, but it was fun.
