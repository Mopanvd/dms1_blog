# record sounds!

In this class, we went to RMIT's Building 8 Level 7 to borrow the H2N microphone recorder. We recorded at least 9 sound effects. I recorded more than 20 sound effects, and I picked out the most suitable 9 sound effects. And edited each sound effect through Audition.

It was also very interesting to find interesting sounds. I needed to find a very quiet place to record. But there were people everywhere at RMIT. So I tried to find a suitable place in the library. Finally, I found it on the tenth floor above the library. Although it was relatively quiet, the air conditioner was also very loud. In the end, the sound I liked the most was the crisp metallic sound of my fingers tapping the cup.
