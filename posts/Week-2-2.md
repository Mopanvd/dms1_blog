## sonic elements

 Matenalisation：
• Emotion
• Attention
• Sounds ears and amotion

Materialization is the use of sound to tell the audience about the material reality of objects behind the screen.

The choice to include sound effects over dialogue may be due to the action and animated nature of the show. Sound effects can indicate the material reality of the animated subject.

For example, the sounds of fists and other objects hitting our characters give us a sense of the weight and impact of the objects and the damage each hit causes to our characters.

Without these sounds, the movements would seem more cartoonish and the animated characters would appear disembodied or invincible.

The sounds of bells and wind are what best reflect this aspect in my videos.
## Music
The music I used is copyright-free music from the Youtube music library. The reason I chose this music is that it sounds very positive and upbeat. And it has a rhythmic beat. It is very suitable for walking videos. It is very good with the transitions.

Music：Thinking of us
