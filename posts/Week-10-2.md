## Self Reflection

# Assignment 1 - Video edit

In this video with the theme of "walking and climbing", I used background music to enhance the changes in mood and rhythm. As the picture changes from gentle walking to climbing the hillside, the music gradually increases, creating an atmosphere from relaxation to tension and then relief. 

The shots I chose emphasize the movement of the body and the changes in the environment, symbolizing an inner exploration and growth. This work not only reflects my love for nature and solitude, but also reflects my initial attempt at the relationship between sound and editing rhythm.

# Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons

I designed 18 interactive icons with the theme of "memory". Each pair of icons changes after clicking, and is accompanied by sound effects, such as a wine glass turning into a milk bottle, symbolizing the transformation of memory.

I tried different styles and finally chose a simple and flat design to enhance unity and recognition.

From sketches to Illustrator, I simplified the details, highlighted the characteristics of the objects, and enhanced the symbolism of the icons.

The color scheme uses soft and nostalgic tones to create emotional coherence and make the entire set of icons more visually attractive.

The changes in sound echo the contrast and rhythm in the visuals, making the graphics and sound effects complement each other.

This project taught me how to visualize abstract emotions into stories told by vision and hearing.

# Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment

I guided players to explore the virtual world through sound and scene design. The huge flowers, music from afar, hidden temples and taverns formed the theme of "discovery and curiosity". The use of virtual cameras and sounds allowed me to better understand the narrative rhythm in three-dimensional space, and prototype testing helped me optimize the guidance path and emotional rhythm. 

The story changes when you climb the small mountain and find that the world is so big.
