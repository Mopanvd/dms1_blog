# This is a storyboard!

First of all, I like aerobic exercise very much. Therefore, I like to go for a walk in the city when I have free time. So the first frame of the storyboard opens the window, which means that the new day is sunny and perfect for walking. Then I arrive under the clock in the center of Melbourne, indicating that this is the place where I passed. Then there is a series of places I walked. Then I arrived at the beach and recorded the beautiful sunset, which means that I spent a day walking. Then the scene changes to me climbing a mountain. There are dozens of seconds of me climbing the mountain, and finally I successfully reach the top.

When editing a video, I will first place all the videos in the right position, and then adjust the length of all the clips. The next step is to select the music. After selecting the music, I will adjust the position of the video clips again to make it better match the music, such as the card point and the starting point, fall and climax.
