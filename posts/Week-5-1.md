Here are four simple exercises. First, for the first icon, I prefer complementary colors. Because this makes the character more prominent and bright, and people can remember it easily. For the second watermelon, I think a single color is better. Because watermelons have fewer colors, the more monotonous the better. I may try other colors later. For the third sword, I prefer complementary colors. Because the difference in color can better reflect the boldness of the sword. For the fourth cassette, I like a single color. Because in my memory, the cassette is an item with fewer colors.
